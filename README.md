## Project Description

This project aims to develop a Two-way Indian Sign Language (ISL) translator that can both convert ISL to speech/text and vice versa. The system is designed to recognize static hand signs from ISL and translate them with high accuracy, providing a seamless communication bridge for the Deaf and Mute (D&M) community.

## Features

- **Two-way Translation:** Convert ISL to text/audio and text to ISL.
- **Gesture Recognition:** High accuracy recognition of static ISL hand signs.
- **Modular Design:** Adaptable gesture recognition system for various applications.
- **Accessibility:** Enhances communication for the D&M community.

## Installation

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Python 3 and `pip` installed. Then, install the required Python packages.

3. **Download Pre-trained Models:**
    Download the necessary pre-trained models and place them in the appropriate directory as required by the project.

## Usage

To use the ISL translator:

1. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python UI.py
    ```

2. **Translate ISL to Text/Audio:**
    - Use your webcam to perform ISL gestures. The system will recognize the signs and display the corresponding text and audio output.

3. **Text to ISL:**
    - Enter text into the provided input field to see the corresponding ISL gestures.
